# Workshop: Collecting and Analyzing Social Media Data with R

This repository contains the materials for a short workshop entitled "Collecting and Analyzing Social Media Data with R," versions of which I have taught at Georgetown University, European University Institute, Pompeu Fabra University, and University of Southern California. It will next be offered at the University of Cologne on December 2017.
