# Workshop: Collecting and Analyzing Social Media Data with R

This repository contains the materials for a short workshop entitled "Collecting and Analyzing Social Media Data with R," versions of which I have taught at Georgetown University, European University Institute, Pompeu Fabra University, University of Southern California, and University of Cologne. It will next be offered at the London School of Economics on January 2018.
